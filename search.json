    "text": "1.1 What is and why shiny\nShiny is an R package that lets you create rich, interactive web applications. Shiny lets you take an existing R script and expose it using a web browser so that you or anybody else can use it outside of R. Shiny is commonly used to:\n\nCommunicate complex workflows to a non-technical audience with informative visualizations and interactive components\nShare your analysis easily with colleagues without having to walk them through details of your script\nHelp inform your understanding of an analysis by creating a user interface to quickly evaluate data\n\nIn the applied sciences world, Shiny can be a very important tool to “bridge the research-management divide”. A common example is the use of Shiny to replace a 500 page document that has hundreds of figures with a simple application that allows the user to jump to an exact slice of the data that they want.\nThere are many advantages to using Shiny over other dashboard platforms. As R users, the value of Shiny is that you only need to know how to use R to create a web application. You do not need to know anything about web programming, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. On the other hand, Shiny gives you the power to tap into this broader suite of web programming tools when you’re ready and have a need to expand your application.\nMore simply, Shiny lets you create a web interface for any R workflow. This means that any custom analysis or graphic you’ve made can be fully integrated into your dashboard, unlike other platforms that may have rigid and less customizable templates.",

The following shows a typical workflow for creating and deploying a Shiny application.\n\n\nYou’ll start by creating the application locally with RStudio on your computer.\n\nIdeally, you’ll also be using version control software like Git and hosting the app in a repository on GitHub. This is not a requirement to building a Shiny app, rather it’s part of a broader workflow for reproducibility and shareability of your code. Git/GitHub is an entirely different topic that’s worth learning but not the focus of this workshop. There are resources available in the Useful Links portion of this website.\nFinally, the app is hosted online using Shiny Server that works with both the ui and server components of the app. More about this later.\n\nA Shiny application is fully interactive - it has both a user interface (UI) and server allowing a user to send requests to the server through the UI. This allows reactivity of the application components, where the content that a user sees on the UI is controlled by their inputs in a fully interactive experience. These applications require combined or separate R scripts that define the UI and server components.",

    "section": "1.3 Reactivity",
    "text": "1.3 Reactivity\nCreating interactive applications in Shiny requires a fundamental shift in how you think about coding. It’s all done in R, but the pieces interact differently. You’re used to an R script running top to bottom - code for a Shiny app runs up, down, and sideways depending on how you structure the components.\nA Shiny app runs from an R script, but instead of executing code linearly, it uses reactive programming that detects when an input is changed on the application, runs the minimal amount of code that uses that input, then updates the output as needed. So, rather than thinking of the script as linear, think of it as having interconnected components that share pieces of information to produce the results.\nThis can be daunting at first because it requires you to think about which pieces of your code require inputs from other pieces and how that information is used to create output. Reactivity creates the building blocks of a Shiny app. Every Shiny app has the following:\n\nUser interface (UI): Includes all inputs and outputs, as well as the appearance of the dashboard. Here, when we say “output” we mean the final product (e.g. a plot, table, etc.) that is placed on the ui, but created by processing inputs sent to the server. In web-speak, this is the front end.\nServer: The guts or engine of how the inputs are used to create the outputs, this is where the working parts of your analysis live. It can be as simple or as complicated as you like. In web-speak, this is the back end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt it’s core, a Shiny app is an R script that contains The ui and server components. In practice, it looks like this:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nui &lt;- fluidPage()\nserver &lt;- function(input, output){}\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\nYou “launch” or run the dashboard by sourcing the script or hitting the green “Run App” button on the top right.\n\nIf you run this code, you’ll see a local web browser pop up. It will be empty because this app does nothing - it’s just a template. All we need to do is populate the ui and server objects with code to do some things. We’ll do that in the next module.",

    "section": "2.2 A simple example",
    "text": "2.2 A simple example\nWe’ll start with a simple application of Shiny. As with most problems, it’s good to start with identifying where you want to go and then work backwards to figure out how to get there. Let’s end with a simple histogram to visualize some data for the normal distribution, but with different sample sizes. To start, we create the simple plot with the random data of a given sample size.\n\ndat &lt;- rnorm(100)\nhist(dat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the sample size:\n\ndat &lt;- rnorm(10)\nhist(dat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to identify our inputs and outputs to use this in a Shiny framework. The input is what we want to be able to modify (the sample size) and the output is the plot. This can all be done in a single script by creating a ui and server component. Inputs and outputs go in the ui object and will include our selection for the sample size and the resulting plot. The server processes the inputs and produces the output, which will be the random sample generation and creation of the plot.\nUsing our template from before:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nui &lt;- fluidPage()\nserver &lt;- function(input, output){}\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\nThen putting this into our template would look something like this:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  numericInput(inputId = 'n', label = 'Sample size', value = 50),\n  plotOutput('myplot')\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output){\n  output$myplot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    dat &lt;- rnorm(input$n)\n    hist(dat)\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\nOkay, so what is happening under the hood when you change the sample size?\n\nThe input value n (you name it) for the server is chosen by the user from the ui. This uses the numericInput() widget.\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  numericInput(inputId = 'n', label = 'Sample size', value = 50),\n  plotOutput('myplot')\n)\n\nShiny recognizes that the input$n value comes from the ui and is used by the server to create the random sample dat.\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output){\n  output$myplot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    dat &lt;- rnorm(input$n)\n    hist(dat)\n  })\n}\n\nThe dat object with sample size n is then used to create a histogram.\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output){\n  output$myplot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    dat &lt;- rnorm(input$n)\n    hist(dat)\n  })\n}\n\nThe plot output named myplot (you name it) is created using the renderPlot() function and appended to the output list of objects in the server function.\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output){\n  output$myplot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    dat &lt;- rnorm(input$n)\n    hist(dat)\n  })\n}\n\nThe plot is then rendered on the ui using plotOutput by referencing the myplot name from the output object\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  numericInput(inputId = 'n', label = 'Sample size', value = 50),\n  plotOutput('myplot')\n)\n\n\nThis is what it looks like in a simple flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this happens each time the input values are changed, such that the output reacts to any change in the input.\nOne other piece of advice to understand app fundamentals is about the standard naming convention for reactive functions. Notice in the example that plotting components for the server and ui have paired functions named renderPlot() and plotOutput(), respectively. Every component of a working Shiny app requires these two pieces to create and show content. The naming convention is similar for other elements of an app, e.g., renderTable() and tableOutput() for tabular content.",

    "section": "2.3 Using the RStudio template",
    "text": "2.3 Using the RStudio template\nAnother useful way of learning the basics of the ui and server is to use the built-in Shiny template in RStudio. Under File -&gt; New File -&gt; Shiny Web App…, you can open a script that has a working Shiny app. Tinkering with this file will teach you a lot about how Shiny works.\nFor now, let’s go with the single file option that puts the entire application in app.R rather than splitting it in two (ui.R, server.R).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try it again from scratch, recreating our simple histogram example. Here’s what the template file looks like:\n\n#\n# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking\n# the 'Run App' button above.\n#\n# Find out more about building applications with Shiny here:\n#\n#    https://shiny.posit.co/\n#\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"Old Faithful Geyser Data\"),\n\n    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins \n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            sliderInput(\"bins\",\n                        \"Number of bins:\",\n                        min = 1,\n                        max = 50,\n                        value = 30)\n        ),\n\n        # Show a plot of the generated distribution\n        mainPanel(\n           plotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n\n    output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R\n        x    &lt;- faithful[, 2]\n        bins &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n\n        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins\n        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white',\n             xlab = 'Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)',\n             main = 'Histogram of waiting times')\n    })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\nThis app template has a lot more pieces than the last example. In particular, the sidebarLayout() format is used for the ui with a sidebarPanel() for the widget selection and a mainPanel() for the plot output.\nWe can replace the relevant pieces with those used in our initial histogram app. What does this app do differently from the original?\nYour final product should look like this:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"My awesome histogram app\"),\n\n    # Sidebar with a numeric input for sample size \n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n           numericInput(inputId = 'n', label = 'Sample size', value = 50)\n        ),\n\n        # Show a plot of the generated distribution\n        mainPanel(\n           plotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n\n    output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n        \n      # generate random sample of size n\n        x &lt;- rnorm(input$n)\n\n        # draw the histogram\n        hist(x)\n        \n    })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\nThis is the same app as before, but we’ve only replaced the relevant pieces, i.e., the title, the numeric input widget, and a simpler plot.\nLet’s spice it up by adding a widget for changing the histogram color. There’s a lot to say about “widgets” - Shiny has many you can choose from depending on the type of input you need. This page provides an overview of available widgets. We’ll add the selectInput() widget for the colors.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"My awesome histogram app\"),\n\n    # Sidebar with a numeric input for sample size \n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n           numericInput(inputId = 'n', label = 'Sample size', value = 50), \n           selectInput(inputId = 'col', label = 'Choose color', choices = c('red', 'blue', 'green'))\n        ),\n\n        # Show a plot of the generated distribution\n        mainPanel(\n           plotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n\n    output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n        \n      # generate random sample of size n\n        x &lt;- rnorm(input$n)\n\n        # draw the histogram\n        hist(x, col = input$col)\n        \n    })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\nNotice how the random sample changes when you update the color. Why is that? How can we fix this?",

    "text": "2.4 Debugging a Shiny app\nFiguring out why and where your code might break in an application is challenging because of the reactivity inherent in a Shiny app. You can’t just run the app step by step as you would a normal R script. The browser() function can be used to “step inside” the R code of an app. The browser() function can work with any arbitrary R function and works similarly with Shiny apps that share many similarities with functions. We’ll first demonstrate how to use it with a simple function.\n\nmy_func &lt;- function(n){\n\n  x &lt;- rnorm(n)\n  hist(x)\n  \n}\nmy_func(n = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s save this code in a new R script, place the browser() function inside of my_func(), and run the code again.\n\nmy_func &lt;- function(n){\n\n  browser()\n  x &lt;- rnorm(n)\n  hist(x)\n  \n}\nmy_func(n = 100)\n\nTwo things happen when the code is run:\n\nThe source code now highlights the browser() function with a green arrow. This indicates your current location inside the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe console will show that you’re in the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowser controls appear at the top of the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now “step” through the function using these controls or by pressing “enter”. The code will run as intended if there are no errors. You will exit the browser once the code execution is complete or if you hit the “Stop” button on the controls. Any objects created inside the function will be available for you to investigate if there are issues.\nThe browser() works the same with a Shiny app. You’ll use it within objects in the server component since these behave as functions. For example:\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  \n  output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    browser()\n    # generate random sample of size n\n    x &lt;- rnorm(input$n)\n    \n    # draw the histogram\n    hist(x, col = input$col)\n    \n  })\n}\n\nThe browser takes a bit of practice to get comfortable, but you’ll quickly find it useful for debugging apps, particularly those that have multiple working parts.

For example, a common use of Shiny is to plot data where there are multiple options to choose the type of data you have, e.g., multiple sampling stations and multiple parameters. Shiny can be used to easily subset parts of the data that are of interest rather than producing all possible combinations.\nWe’ll create an interactive time series plot where users can select a station from a drop-down menu and see the time series for any of the available indicators chosen from another drop-down selection.\n\n\n\nComplex app to create using water quality data from Tampa Bay, FL.\n\n\nIn this extended tutorial, we will explore more complex topics of reactivity and data wrangling with dplyr. We’ll also demonstrate the advantages of using R libraries that wrap JavaScript functionality, in particular using plotly{target =“_blank”} to make static plots more interactive.\n\n2.5.1 Prepare data\nFirst, let’s prepare the water quality data for our app using a dataset from the Tampa Bay Estuary Program R package tbeptools.\n\nlibrary(tbeptools)\nepcdata\n\n# A tibble: 28,501 × 26\n   bay_segment epchc_station SampleTime             yr    mo Latitude Longitude\n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 HB                      6 2024-12-09 09:27:00  2024    12     27.9     -82.5\n 2 HB                      7 2024-12-09 09:38:00  2024    12     27.9     -82.5\n 3 HB                      8 2024-12-09 11:42:00  2024    12     27.9     -82.4\n 4 MTB                     9 2024-12-09 11:02:00  2024    12     27.8     -82.4\n 5 MTB                    11 2024-12-09 09:52:00  2024    12     27.8     -82.5\n 6 MTB                    13 2024-12-09 10:04:00  2024    12     27.8     -82.5\n 7 MTB                    14 2024-12-09 10:37:00  2024    12     27.8     -82.5\n 8 MTB                    16 2024-12-16 09:44:00  2024    12     27.7     -82.5\n 9 MTB                    19 2024-12-16 09:59:00  2024    12     27.7     -82.6\n10 LTB                    23 2024-12-16 13:33:00  2024    12     27.7     -82.6\n# ℹ 28,491 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: Total_Depth_m &lt;dbl&gt;, Sample_Depth_m &lt;dbl&gt;, tn &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   tn_q &lt;chr&gt;, sd_m &lt;dbl&gt;, sd_raw_m &lt;dbl&gt;, sd_q &lt;chr&gt;, chla &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   chla_q &lt;chr&gt;, Sal_Top_ppth &lt;dbl&gt;, Sal_Mid_ppth &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Sal_Bottom_ppth &lt;dbl&gt;, Temp_Water_Top_degC &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Temp_Water_Mid_degC &lt;dbl&gt;, Temp_Water_Bottom_degC &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Turbidity_JTU-NTU` &lt;chr&gt;, Turbidity_Q &lt;chr&gt;, Color_345_F45_PCU &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\nThe epcdata (?epcdata for details) object is a long-term time series starting in the 1970s collected monthly at numerous stations in Tampa Bay by the Environmental Protection Commission (EPC) of Hillsborough County. There are also numerous parameters that are measured.\nHow should we prepare epcdata for use with the dashboard? Remember, our goals are to be able to create a time series and map for a selected station and parameter:\n\nLet’s assume we only want three indicators: Total Nitrogen (mg/L) (tn), Chlorophyll-a (ug/L) (chla), and Secchi depth (m) (sd_m). Based on tidy principles, we want each row to capture a unique “observation” and any co-varying “variables” (such as location and time). This will allow us to easily filter rows for plotting.\nThe epcdata is currently in wide format, with each variable as its own column. We want to pivot it to long format so that each row is an observation of a single indicator. The dplyr package is the ‘swiss army knife’ (or ‘plyers’) for data wrangling, along with its close cousin tidyr. Let’s look at some basic operations: filtering, selecting, and pivoting. Be sure to reference Posit Cheatsheets like Data tidying with tidyr :: Cheatsheet and Data transformation with dplyr :: Cheatsheet.\nFilter\n\nReduce rows based on condition(s) that evaluate logically (i.e. True or False)\nepcdata |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(epchch_station == 8)\nSelect\n\nReduce columns to only those specified\nepcdata |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(\n    station = epchc_station, \n    SampleTime,\n    lon     = Longitude,\n    lat     = Latitude)\nPivot\n\nTransform the data from wide to long format\nepcdata |&gt; \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    names_to  = \"var\", \n    values_to = \"val\")\n\nApplying the above concepts, create a new folder app-wq for the water quality app and create the R file app.R inside the folder with the following contents:\n\n# * load libraries ----\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(tbeptools)\n\n# * prep data ----\nd &lt;- epcdata |&gt;\n  select(\n    station                 = epchc_station,\n    SampleTime,\n    `Total Nitrogen (mg/L)` = tn,\n    `Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)`  = chla,\n    `Secchi depth (m)`      = sd_m) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    names_to  = \"indicator\",\n    values_to = \"value\",\n    `Total Nitrogen (mg/L)`:`Secchi depth (m)`)\nd\n\n# A tibble: 85,503 × 4\n   station SampleTime          indicator               value\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1       6 2024-12-09 09:27:00 Total Nitrogen (mg/L)   0.246\n 2       6 2024-12-09 09:27:00 Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)    6.6  \n 3       6 2024-12-09 09:27:00 Secchi depth (m)        1.9  \n 4       7 2024-12-09 09:38:00 Total Nitrogen (mg/L)   0.352\n 5       7 2024-12-09 09:38:00 Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)    3.9  \n 6       7 2024-12-09 09:38:00 Secchi depth (m)        2.8  \n 7       8 2024-12-09 11:42:00 Total Nitrogen (mg/L)   0.315\n 8       8 2024-12-09 11:42:00 Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)    5.3  \n 9       8 2024-12-09 11:42:00 Secchi depth (m)      NaN    \n10       9 2024-12-09 11:02:00 Total Nitrogen (mg/L)   0.18 \n# ℹ 85,493 more rows\n\n\nWe additionally need to prepare data for the following elements:\n\nStations\nList of unique station numbers for selecting from a drop-down menu.\nIndicators\nList of unique indicators for selecting from a drop-down menu.\n\n\n# * data for select ----\nstations   &lt;- unique(d$station)\nindicators &lt;- unique(d$indicator)\n\nstations\n\n [1]  6  7  8  9 11 13 14 16 19 23 24 25 28 32 33 36 38 40 41 44 46 47 50 51 52\n[26] 55 60 63 64 65 66 67 68 70 71 73 80 81 82 84 90 91 92 93 95\n\nindicators\n\n[1] \"Total Nitrogen (mg/L)\" \"Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)\"  \"Secchi depth (m)\"     \n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Add User Interface\nLet’s add dropdown menus for station and indicator selection and a placeholder for the plotly output. These outputs are htmlwidgets that allow additional interactivity. They will also be update based on user input.\n\n#  ui.R ----\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n  # * layout ----\n  wellPanel(\n    h2(\"Water Quality\"),\n    \n    # * input widgets ----\n    selectInput(\"sel_sta\", \"Station\",   choices = stations),\n    selectInput(\"sel_ind\", \"Indicator\", choices = indicators),\n    \n    # * output htmlwidgets ----\n    plotlyOutput(\"tsplot\")\n  )\n\n)\n\nNotice that shiny::fluidPage() and shiny::wellPanel() functions are used for the layout. For more details, check out Shiny - Application layout guide. For even more advanced layout options, checkout shinydashboard and bslib R packages.\nNotice that plotly::plotlyOutput() is used to layout the htmlwidget. We need these components because we’ll be updating them interactively based on user input with server-side functions.\n\n\n2.5.3 Add Server functions\nLet’s add renderPlotly() to update the time series plot based on user inputs. The renderPlotly() function takes a plotly interactive plot object. We can use the plotly::ggplotly() function to take a static ggplot2 plot object and make it an interactive plotly object. Using ggplot2 allows us to take advantage of the Grammar of Graphics principles to render plots using a layered approach (see cheatsheet, summary or book).\nThe get_data() component allows us to generate a data frame reactive to user inputs and available for use across multiple server-side functions (although here we only use one). For more, see Shiny - Use reactive expressions.\n\n#  server.R ----\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # * get_data(): reactive to inputs ----\n  get_data &lt;- reactive({\n    d |&gt;\n      filter(\n        station   == input$sel_sta,\n        indicator == input$sel_ind)\n  })\n\n  # * tsplot: time series plot ----\n  output$tsplot &lt;- renderPlotly({\n    g &lt;- ggplot(\n      get_data(),\n      aes(\n        x = SampleTime,\n        y = value) ) +\n      geom_line() +\n      labs(y = input$sel_ind)\n    ggplotly(g)\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Final app\nNow with all the pieces, your app should work as intended. Try running it by placing shinyApp(ui, server) at the bottom of your file and sourcing the entire script. The finished product should look like this:\n\n# Goal: Create an app to show a time series by station and indicator\n#   includes map of selected station\n\n# global.R ----\n\n# * load libraries ----\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(tbeptools)\n\n# * prep data ----\nd &lt;- epcdata |&gt;\n  select(\n    station                 = epchc_station,\n    SampleTime,\n    lat                     = Latitude,\n    lon                     = Longitude,\n    `Total Nitrogen (mg/L)` = tn,\n    `Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)`  = chla,\n    `Secchi depth (m)`      = sd_m) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    names_to  = \"indicator\",\n    values_to = \"value\",\n    `Total Nitrogen (mg/L)`:`Secchi depth (m)`)\n\n# * data for select ----\nstations   &lt;- unique(d$station)\nindicators &lt;- unique(d$indicator)\n\n#  ui.R ----\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  wellPanel(\n    h2(\"Water Quality\"),\n    selectInput(\"sel_sta\", \"Station\",   choices = stations),\n    selectInput(\"sel_ind\", \"Indicator\", choices = indicators),\n    plotlyOutput(\"tsplot\")\n  )\n)\n\n#  server.R ----\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  # * get_data(): reactive to inputs ----\n  get_data &lt;- reactive({\n    d |&gt;\n      filter(\n        station   == input$sel_sta,\n        indicator == input$sel_ind)\n  })\n  \n  # * tsplot: time series plot ----\n  output$tsplot &lt;- renderPlotly({\n    g &lt;- ggplot(\n      get_data(),\n      aes(\n        x = SampleTime,\n        y = value) ) +\n      geom_line() +\n      labs(y = input$sel_ind)\n    ggplotly(g)\n  })\n \n}\n\n# run ----\nshinyApp(ui, server)",

    "section": "3.1 Sharing your Shiny application",
    "text": "3.1 Sharing your Shiny application\nNow that you know the basics of creating a Shiny application, the next step is to learn how to share it with others or yourself at different locations. There are several ways this can be done and each comes with tradeoffs in the level of control and ease of setup. We’ll present a few options and you can decide which is preferred for your needs.\n\n\n3.1.1 Sharing the script\nBecause a Shiny app is simply an R script or two (i.e., app.R or server.R and ui.R), they can be shared directly with others for use on their own machines. The advantage of this approach is that file sizes are small and easily shareable, although there are several disadvantages. First, any data that an app requires must also be shared. This can be simple if the data are small, but can quickly become tedious if multiple files are required or the data are larger than a few megabytes. The second and more important disadvantage is that your intended user must know how to use R and has the required dependencies (packages) installed on their machine. For these reasons, this mode of sharing is not a recommended approach for most applications.\n\n\n3.1.2 Sharing on GitHub\nCode for an app can also be shared on GitHub as a repository, similar to how it would be structured on your own machine.\n\nshiny::runGitHub('tbep-tech/nwqmc-shiny', subdir = 'app-wq')\n\nThe disadvantages of this approach are similar to the previous example. A user must already know how to use R and the required packages must already be installed. The app is also not actually hosted on GitHub - only the code is made accessible. Further, this approach assumes you have a working knowledge of Git/GitHub and version control. There are some helpful resources in our Useful Links page for those interested in learning more.\n\n\n3.1.3 ShinyApps.io\nThe easiest and most portable approach to hosting an app is using ShinyApps.io. Hosting on this service makes a publicly accessible web page for your app and allows you to host up to five apps for free. The free version is suitable for personal use and sharing with a handful of others, but it will quickly run out of the allowed hours if your app has more than a few users. Additional pricing options are available, although they may be prohibitive for individuals at the higher tiers. Visit Shiny - Getting started with shinyapps.io to run through the following sequence:\n\nInstall the rsconnect R package.\nCreate an account at ShinyApps.io.\nConfigure rsconnect with a token in RStudio.\nPublish the app from RStudio using deployApp().\n\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that your app is hosted on a third-party server with limited ability to fine tune or customize the setup. This limitation is likely not a huge concern for most users. Those wanting more freedom and ownership of the hosting service should use the final option below.\n\n\n3.1.4 NALMS server\nThe North American Lake Management Society (NALMS) hosts a shiny server on nalms.shinyapps.io as a free paid service for water resources apps. The service is paid for by NALMS and has all of the advantages of ShinyApps.io, without the need for an individual user to pay for a higher-tier subscription service. Simply use the contact information on the main page to request hosting for your app. The advantage of this approach is that the service is free and is hosted at the higher end of the pricing plan with plenty of computational resources to accommodate multiple apps. The disadvantages are similar to the previous example.\n\n\n3.1.5 Shiny Server or Docker\nPosit provides an open source version of Shiny Server that allows you to host apps on an internal or personal server. This may be desired if you want full control over the server and customization of the settings. Apps can also be hosted behind a firewall for an added level of security. However, this requires some knowledge of server settings and use of a Linux operating system that is common on remote servers. A dedicated server space is also needed, which usually requires a paid service, such as through Google or Amazon hosting. Apps can also be hosted with Shiny Server using Docker that “containerizes” an easily portable bundle of your app. Machines or servers only need to have Docker installed to run an app. Assuming you have comfort with server management, this is the best option for full control of hosting, although it comes with overhead of requiring server space and full management of app dependencies.",

    "section": "3.2 IT hurdles",
    "text": "3.2 IT hurdles\nOne of the biggest challenges developing and deploying Shiny applications is having support from your institution’s IT or administrative staff. Nearly all of these deployment options are not viable if you do not have administrative privileges on your computer nor the ability to host and expose internal applications outside of your institution. So, the challenge becomes acceptance of the new approach rather than the technical logistics of hosting. There is no simple solution to this issue, but we offer some suggestions as you begin or continue your journey developing robust applications.\n\nDemonstrate the value of the tool: IT or administrative staff may be more willing to accept these new approaches if they can see the value it has for the organization. Presenting a functional, useful, and well designed application can go a long way in changing opinions on whether adopting the new technology is worthwhile.\nTransparency in process: Clearly explaining the logistics of creating an application and the deployment requirements may be necessary to address concerns that IT staff may have about exposing content to external users. Having them understand IT requirements will also ensure that any deployment system that is setup will meet the needs for your application. This may require explaining which packages are required and what computational resources are needed. Specific versions for R packages, R itself, and Shiny Server (if used) should also be discussed.\nData: Having a discussion about how data will be used by the application may also be needed. This discussion could serve two purposes. First, IT staff may have concerns about data ownership or if the application will share any sensitive information. Hosting the application on a third-party server may mean that the data are now external to your organization if included as files within the application. This may not be a huge concern if the data are not sensitive, but this potential issue should be stated upfront if a solution is needed. Any application that uses sensitive information (e.g., personal data) should also anonymize or otherwise not present this information directly. The second purpose of this discussion may be more technical if hosting the data with an application is prohibitive given the size. Shiny applications can use external databases as a data source and you may need to discuss with IT staff how this is accomplished. Using an external database may also greatly improve app performance.\nLicensing: The open source community has a well-established practice of licensing that defines how others may or may not use software or data. The license does not directly control how others could use your app, but it does establish a legal framework for use should it be needed with bad actors. Explaining the purpose and value of licensing to IT staff could address any legal concerns about sharing software and data publicly. Guidance on choosing an appropriate license can be found at https://choosealicense.com/.\nInternal applications: Controlling access to an application may be all that is needed to convince IT or administrative staff that hosting is okay. Many of the hosting services described above can be configured with credential authentication that requires a login for access. Additional services provided by Posit (e.g., Posit Connect) can also be used to setup an internal server accessible only within the organization. Posit has recognized the value of enterprising their services (at a cost) and has developed hosting products to serve these needs.",

First, you can use an RStudio project setup on Posit Cloud (preferred) or you can use your own version of R and RStudio on your laptop. The instructions below describe setup for each.\nPlease reach out if you have any issues with installation: mbeck@tbep.org\nPosit Cloud provides an environment to use RStudio through a web browser. It’s useful as a workshop resource because necessary packages and scripts are already included. After the workshop, you’ll want to continue work with R and RStudio installed on your own computer.\nWe’ve created a workspace on Posit Cloud that includes all of the content for this workshop. Open the following URL in a web browser: https://posit.cloud/content/9569756\nYou will see a login screen that looks like this:\nSign up using a personal login or existing account (Google, GitHub, etc.).\nYou’ll see the workspace in your browser once you’ve signed in. You’ll need to make a permanent copy to save your work. Just click the button at the top marked “+ Save as Permanent Copy”. When this is done, the red text at the top indicating “TEMPORARY COPY” will no longer be visible.\nNow you can follow along with the workshop content.",

    "text": "A.2 Install R and RStudio\nYou can also use R and RStudio on your local computer for this workshop. Posit Cloud is setup as a convenience and you will want to work locally with R after the workshop.\nMost of the steps below will require administrative privileges on a computer. Work with your IT staff to complete the setup if you do not have these privileges. As an alternative, you can use Posit Cloud to participate (see Section A.1), although we strongly encourage you to install the software on your personal computer for use after the workshop.\nR and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing software. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio.\nThanks to the USGS-R Training group and Data Carpentry for making their installation materials available. The following instructions come directly from their materials, with a few minor edits to help you get set up.\n\nA.2.1 Windows: Download and install R\nGo to CRAN and download the R installer for Windows. Make sure to choose the latest stable version (v4.2.3 as of April 2023).\nOnce the installer downloads, Right-click on it and select “Run as administrator”.\nType in your credentials and click yes (or if you don’t have administrator access have your IT rep install with Admin privileges).\n\nYou can click next through the standard dialogs and accept most defaults. But at the destination screen, please verify that it is installing it to C:\\Program Files\\R\n\nAt the “Select Components” screen, you can accept the default and install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.\n\nAt this screen, uncheck ‘Create a desktop icon’ because non-admin users in Windows will be unable to delete it.\n\n\n\nA.2.2 Windows: Download and install RStudio\nDownload RStudio from here.\nAfter download, double-click the installer. It will ask for your administrator credentials to install (you might need to have your IT rep install again).\nAccept all the default options for the RStudio install.\n\n\n\nA.2.3 macOS: Download and install R\n\nDownload and install R from the CRAN website for Mac here.\nSelect the .pkg file for the latest R version\nDouble click on the downloaded file to install R\nIt is also a good idea to install XQuartz (needed by some packages)\n\n\n\nA.2.4 macOS: Download and install RStudio\n\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select the appropriate RStudio download file for macOS\nDouble click the file to install RStudio\n\n\n\nA.2.5 Check Install\nOnce installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu. Start up RStudio. Once running it should look something like this:",

A free option is available, with additional paid tiers depending on your needs. Although there are other free options, this website is the easiest and quickest way to host a Shiny application.\nFirst, navigate to shinyapps.io and click the “Sign Up” button. After you’ve setup your GitHub account, you can sign up for shinyapps.io by selecting the GitHub sign up option.\n\nNext, install the rsconnect package in R. This package lets you connect to shinyapps.io and push applications from your local computer.\n\ninstall.packages(\"rsconnect\")\n\nYou need to obtain an access token from shinyapps.io to configure the rsconnect package to use your account. In your shinyapps.io dashboard, click your user name on the top right and select Tokens.\n\nAdd a new token, copy/paste the command to setup your account info, and execute it in the R console. It will look something like this and there will a button that allows you to copy the command to your clipboard, where &lt;TOKEN&gt; and &lt;SECRET&gt; are specific to your account and should not be shared.\n\nrsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='beckmw',\n              token='&lt;TOKEN&gt;',\n              secret='&lt;SECRET&gt;')\n\nNow you will be able to push a Shiny application to your shinyapps.io account as follows.\n\nlibrary(rsconnect)\ndeployApp()\n\nMore info can be found here.",

    "text": "B.4 Data structures in R\nNow we can talk about R data structures. Simply put, a data structure is a way for programming languages to handle information storage.\n\nB.4.1 Vectors (one-dimensional data)\nThe basic data format in R is a vector - a one-dimensional grouping of elements that have the same type. These are all vectors and they are created with the c (concatenate) function:\n\ndbl_var &lt;- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)\nint_var &lt;- c(1L, 6L, 10L)\nlog_var &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)\nchr_var &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nThe four types of vectors are double (or numeric), integer, logical, and character. The following functions can return useful information about the vectors:\n\nclass(dbl_var)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nlength(log_var)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\nB.4.2 Data frames (two-dimensional data)\nA collection of vectors represented as one data object are often described as two-dimensional data, like a spreadsheet, or in R speak, a data frame. Here’s a simple example:\n\nltrs &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nnums &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nlogs &lt;- c(T, F, T)\nmydf &lt;- data.frame(ltrs, nums, logs)\nmydf\n\n  ltrs nums  logs\n1    a    1  TRUE\n2    b    2 FALSE\n3    c    3  TRUE\n\n\nThe only constraints required to make a data frame are:\n\nEach column (vector) contains the same type of data\nThe number of observations in each column is equal.",
