# Experimental Lakes {.unnumbered}

## Background

Founded in 1968, the IISD Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario, Canada is a research area containing 58 specially preserved freshwater lakes for aquatic, biological, chemical research, and more. Run by the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the IISD-ELA regularly carries out large-scale experiments that would otherwise be impossible to perform in highly populated areas. Their research has yielded important insights into the long-term environmental impacts of modifications in freshwater lake systems, and has provided a steady stream of important research for the scientific community. The dashboard showcases 50 years worth of ecosystem experiments performed at these lakes.
