# Piney Point Data {.unnumbered}

## Background

Piney Point is a former fertilizer processing facility on the southeast shore of Tampa Bay.  In March 2021, 215 million gallons of nutrient-rich wastewater from Piney Point were discharged to Tampa Bay.  This dashboard provides a summary of the response-based monitoring data collected in 2021 to assess the effects of this large nutrient influx on the bay's resources.
