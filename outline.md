# Agenda outline

To cover: 

* Shiny use case (why Shiny)
* Shiny
     * Fundamentals of reactivity
     * Showcase mode
     * Shiny example (from concept to product)
* Shiny AI
* Deployment
* Overcoming IT hurdles

Use Posit Cloud to follow along

Random ideas:

* Deployment issues - NALMS as a solution, Posit enterprise products
* Use histogram example as basic, time series example for wq as more complex
* For AI, explain caveats, it's somewhat trusted given that Posit is the maintainer, use it as a troubleshooting tool or enhancer (make the histogram example bette)
* Show examples of what can be done (fully built shiny examples)
* be transparent - the goal is to be understand what's possible and have the foundation to build your skills
