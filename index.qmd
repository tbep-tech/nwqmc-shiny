# About this Workshop {.unnumbered}

The [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/){target="_blank"} R package is over ten years old and is a popular tool to create immersive, web-based content. Although many water quality scientists and professionals have experience with R, expertise in dashboards is uncommon. This workshop will introduce the fundamentals of building Shiny dashboards in R using real-world examples with hands-on coding exercises. The benefits of developing Shiny dashboards and their potential applications to improve research, monitoring, and management will be discussed. Special attention will be on the merits of open source software for creating reproducible and transparent dashboard workflows, including addressing common deployment and IT hurdles. Attendees are strongly encouraged to bring their own laptops to follow along with the workshop exercises. Anyone interested in learning how to expand existing R skills for dashboard development will benefit from this workshop. This includes student, early career, and advanced professionals from any employment sector and field of expertise.
